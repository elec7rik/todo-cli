# TODO CLI App
This repo contains the code to create a simple todo-cli app.  
It has the functionality to add tasks and mark them as complete(indicated as **false** in db.json).  
I wrote this code following a freecodecamp [tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-build-a-to-do-app-with-rust/)  

## Functionality
The todo-cli app offers the following functionality:  
  
**Add task**  
`cargo run -- add "code rust"`  
  
**Set task as complete**  
`cargo run -- complete "code rust"`
